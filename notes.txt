 you see how the three files look where parents have children whose names are in students and onboarding also has those students in students.xlsx.......i want you to see how they are and give me 3 similar files, one for students, one for parents and one for onboarding -- with same headers but different parents , different emails, different names , different children etc-----i empahsize you see how the students in students.xlsx are being used in onboarding.xlsx and parents.xlsx in children section,,,see how they use only first name and last name in some parts and some parts they use all names including middlename,,,, dont screw this up, i wont be able to upload these for reference again,,,,,the ones i have uploaded is data for one fake school, now create for another fake school---remember they should have different emails and phonenumbers and names and details as the mongodb is the same----also another thing that really matters is that the three xlsx files you give me actually are conected like the ones i gave you

the next year carryover should check fo feerules of next class...or maybe they should remain as excess till the new year comes in

fees is caching alot 

add pricing , and pilot complete as well think very much on how we will actually bill customers and how i would maybe increase it without losing them , will it be modular, will it be entire app, will it be per student, how to bill different amounts to different sizes of schools 

free alternatives to sendgrid for forgot password , registering admin

make it so , if the school has paybil, they have an option to use it to automate fees that way im not going losses all i have to is to check---can do same with bank apis as well, that way theres both manual and automated options, if the school does use some api, the parent flow of confirming payment should not show , they just pay paybill and stuff is just automated , but if no paybill or bank api you can show the parent admin fee confirmation flow.

download videos on ow to pitch and stuff , also use chatgpt and see the best way how to do it...
