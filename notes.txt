    Exceeding Expectation (EE) (80%-100%):
    The student performs well above the expected standard for their learning stage. 

Meeting Expectation (ME) (50%-79%):
The student's performance meets the expected standard. 
Approaching Expectation (AE) (40%-49%):
The student is progressing towards the expected standard but needs some support. 
Below Expectation (BE) (0%-39%):
The student's performance is below the expected standards, requiring significant support to catch up.
