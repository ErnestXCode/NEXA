add confirm fee flow for parents and admin is the one to confirm them

the next year carryover should check fo feerules of next class...or maybe they should remain as excess till the new year comes in

fees history page for parents and admins/bursars as well

add streams to classes  

add pricing , think very much on how we will actually bill customers and how i would maybe increase it without losing them , will it be modular, will it be entire app, will it be per student, how to bill different amounts to different sizes of schools 

free alternatives to sendgrid for forgot password , registering admin

make it so , if the school has paybil, they have an option to use it to automate fees that way im not going losses all i have to is to check---can do same with bank apis as well, that way theres both manual and automated options, if the school does use some api, the parent flow of confirming payment should not show , they just pay paybill and stuff is just automated , but if no paybill or bank api you can show the parent admin fee confirmation flow.
