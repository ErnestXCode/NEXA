dashboard not loading for teachers only 
communcation as well
restating shows 404 not found from vercel
maybe the calls aint working at all, i think

details show up in these tabs man, most likely pulling all teachers and bursars

attendance doesnt update as soon as its marked in the view attendance, but its not like every one will stay there forver

when changing days i think i would like for all to be present, but for the day marked to remain the same 

marking attendance takes forever., as in saving 

the cards in mark attendance is abit misleading for admin , coz its not taking classes into account, maybe there should be overall for admin to show how much each class is contributing to attendance , which ones marked recently, how many times a class has been marked , a grapgh comparing attendance between classes , etc and stuff like that 


i wonder if i need a view results page, also print report card should be possible

total outstanding fees  , diff fees for diff classes  

fees is not updating right away 

classes, stream and grading arent actually being used
