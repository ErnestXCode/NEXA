Got it — so no paid external services for MVP. For free options: for emails you can use EmailJS (free tier) or Gmail SMTP with limits, and for notifications you can use Firebase Cloud Messaging free tier or Pusher Beams free tier for push notifications. They’re limited but fine for small schools in MVP.
